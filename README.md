## Command Line
Use the Test project's `Program.cs` as the startup project, and just run.

## Unit Testing
Utilize Test Explorer in Visual Studio or visit `GeneratorTests.cs` in the `BenGenerator.Test` project and run all tests.
* _Be warned that there is one test that creates an `int.MaxValue` number of records, and this test will take four and a half minutes to complete._
